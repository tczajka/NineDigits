# NineDigits

NineDigits is a game engine for two-player Sudoku.

# Rules of the game

Two players alternate placing digits on an initially empty [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) grid. Additional rules are:
* You must always keep the Sudoku solvable.
* You can't play trivial moves that are already implied by other digits.
* The player that makes the final move wins. The final move makes the Sudoku have a unique solution.
